Activity 03 - Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)
================

This activity is intended to be completed in one week - outside of class
preparation work and two 75-minute class meetings. On our Blackboard
course site you were provided with items to read, watch, and do prior to
attempting this activity. Do not proceed in this activity until you have
minimally:

1.  (Day 1 portion) Read *ISL* [Section
    3.2](https://hastie.su.domains/ISLR2/ISLRv2_website.pdf).
2.  (Day 2 portion) Read *ISL* [Sections 3.3.1 &
    3.3.2](https://hastie.su.domains/ISLR2/ISLRv2_website.pdf).
3.  (Day 3 portion) Read *ISL* [Section
    3.3.3](https://hastie.su.domains/ISLR2/ISLRv2_website.pdf).

In this repository/directory, you should see five items:

- `README-img` - a folder containing images that I am embedding within
  this `README.md` file and other files. You do not need to do anything
  with this.
- `.gitignore` - a file that is used to specify what Git can ignore when
  pushing to GitHub. You do not need to do anything with this.
- `README.md` - the document you are currently reading.
- `day01-quantitative-explanatory` - a folder that contains items for
  you to complete during the first class meeting.
- `day02-qualitative-explanatory` - a folder that contains items for you
  to complete during the second class meeting.
- `day03-other-considerations` - a folder that contains items for you to
  complete during the third class meeting.

We will explore most of these items over this week. Before doing that,
you will first make your own copy of this repository.

Do you want an interactive way to check your understanding outside of
class? Remember that these are a good way to check your foundation
understanding and were created by [Benjamin
Baumer](https://beanumber.github.io/www/) (associate professor at Smith
College), in collaboration with the OpenIntro team and others. The
following tutorials will provide you with an applied approach to our
topics (reorganized to better correspond with our readings):

Days 1, 2, & 3:

- *ISL* 3.2 & 3.3 - [Multiple
  regression](https://openintro.shinyapps.io/ims-03-model-08/)

Note that this tutorial covers materials for this week and next week.

## Day 1: Forking & cloning

### Forking

Read these directions first, then work through them. In this GitHub repo
(i.e., my repo):

1.  Click on the ![fork](README-img/fork-icon.png) **Fork** icon near
    the upper-right-hand corner. You will be taken to a **Create a new
    fork** screen.
2.  Verify that your GitHub username is selected under **Owner** and
    that the **Repository name** is `activity03-mlr` with a green check
    mark (this verifies that you do not already have a GitHub repository
    with this name).
3.  You may provide a **Description** if you would like. This is a way
    to provide some additional, more descriptive, meta information
    related to the things you did. I like to provide a brief description
    of what happened.
4.  Verify that **Copy the `main` branch only** is selected.
5.  Click on the green **Create fork** button at the bottom of this
    page.

You should be taken a copy of this repo that is in your GitHub account.
That is, your page title should be `username/activity03-mlr`, where
`username` is replaced with your GitHub username. Directly below this,
you will see the following message:

> forked from
> [gvsu-sta631/activity03-mlr](https://github.com/gvsu-sta631/activity03-mlr)

You will complete the rest of this activity in **your** forked copy of
the `activity03-mlr` repo.

### Cloning

Read these directions first, then work through them. Note that you will
be switching between RStudio and your GitHub repo (that you previously
forked).

1.  In RStudio, click on the
    <img src="README-img/rproj-icon.png" alt="RStudio Project" width = "20"/>
    icon (the icon below the Edit drop-down menu).
2.  Click on **Version Control** on the *New Project Wizard* pop-up.
3.  Click on **Git** and you should be on a ‚ÄúClone Git Repository‚Äù page.
4.  Back to **your** `activity03-mlr` GitHub repo, click on the green
    **Code** button near the top of the page.
5.  Verify that **HTTPS** is underlined in orange/red on the drop-down
    menu, then copy the URL provided.
6.  Back in RStudio, paste the URL in the ‚ÄúRepository URL‚Äù text field.
7.  The ‚ÄúProject directory name‚Äù text field should have automatically
    populated with `activity03-mlr`. If yours did not (this is usually
    an issue on Macs),
    - Click back into the ‚ÄúRepository URL‚Äù text field.
    - Highlight any bit of this text (it does not seem to matter what or
      how much).
    - Press Ctrl/Cmd and the ‚ÄúProject directory name‚Äù should now have
      automatically populated with `activity03-mlr`.
8.  In the ‚ÄúCreate project as subdirectory of‚Äù field, click on
    **Browse‚Ä¶**. Create a **New Folder** called ‚ÄúSTA 631‚Äù, then within
    this folder, create a **New Folder** called ‚ÄúActivities‚Äù, then click
    **Choose**. If you already have this, you can simply browse to ‚ÄúSTA
    631/Activities‚Äù, then click **Choose**. Note that I am forcing you
    to use my opinionated file system management style.
9.  Click on **Create Project**.

Your screen should refresh and the **Files** pane should say that you
are currently in your `activity03-mlr` folder that currently has the
same files and folders as your GitHub repo. If you are asked for your
GitHub credentials, provide your GitHub username and your PAT (not your
password).

Take a moment to reflect on what is possibly your second time doing this
forking process.

- What was easier this time?
- What is still muddy?
- What do you need to try/do/explore to help with this muddiness?

### One quantitative response variable and two quantitative explanatory variable

You will continue using your data from Activity 2 or find a new dataset
that contains one quantitative response variable, at least two
quantitative explanatory variables (for Days 1, 2, & 3), and at least
one qualitative explanatory variable (for Days 2 & 3).

Read these directions first, then work through them.

1.  In your `activity03-mlr` repo folder/directory, locate and click
    into the `day01-quantitative-explanatory` subfolder.
2.  In the `day01-quantitative-explanatory` subfolder, you will be
    greeted by a new `README.md` file. Do your best to complete the
    tasks/directions provide in this subfolder by **11:59 pm (EST) on
    Tue, Jan 31**.
3.  Ask questions in class as you are working. If you need to finish
    this up outside of our class meetings, remember that you can use our
    Teams workspace (linked on Blackboard), and post questions/issues in
    the **Muddy** channel. If someone else already posted what you
    though was muddy, add any clarification to their post and give them
    a ‚Äú+ 1‚Äù üëç. Remember that this space is for conversations as well as
    posting questions. Read through your peers‚Äô muddy posts and do your
    best to provide help.

### Day 2: Updating your forked GitHub repo

You will need to start reading these directions back at my
`gvsu-sta631/activity03-mlr` GitHub repo **and** have your forked
`username/activity03-mlr` GitHub repo handy. I recommend that you have
my repo opened on one half of your screen and your repo opened on the
other half. Read these directions first, then work through them.

1.  At the top of your `username/activity03-mlr` repo (above the repo
    contents section), verify that you see a message that looks
    something like:

> This branch is X commits behind gvsu-sta631:main.

2.  Click on the hyperlinked ‚ÄúX commits behind‚Äù portion of that message
    to be taken to a **Comparing changes** page.
3.  Verify that your drop-down menu options specify:
    - base repository: username/activity03-mlr
    - base: main
    - head repository: gvsu-sta631/activity03-mlr
    - compare: main
4.  Also verify that you have a message directly below this that says:

> ‚úì Able to merge. These branches can be automatically merged.

Flag me if you see something different.

5.  Click on the green **Create pull request** button under this
    previous message. Note you can look at the changes that I made, if
    you so desire, by scrolling down. However, this is not necessary.
6.  On the next page, provide a short descriptive message in the ‚ÄúTitle‚Äù
    box (e.g., ‚ÄúAdding Day 2 materials‚Äù). You can also provide a more
    detailed message in the ‚ÄúLeave a comment‚Äù box if you choose.
7.  Click on the green **Create pull request** button.
8.  On the next screen which is titled the same thing as what you
    provided in the ‚ÄúTitle‚Äù box on the previous screen, you will be
    presented with a bunch of information. If you scroll down a little,
    you should see a green check mark with a message that specifies:

> This branch has no conflicts with the base branch

And you can click on the green **Merge pull request**.

9.  You will be provided with with an opportunity to provide another
    meaningful message (or accept the default message). Finally, click
    on the green **Confirm merge** button. You can now work directly
    from your `username/activity03-mlr` repo.

In summary, what you just did is pulled my changes into your repository.
Git and GitHub refer to this as a ‚Äúpull request‚Äù because you are asking
to pull items into your repo.

### Assessing a multiple linear regression model

In your `username/activity03-mlr` repo, go into the
`day02-qualitative-explanatory` subfolder and follow the tasks listed in
the `README`. You will continue to work in your `activity03.Rmd` file
that you started during Day 1 of this activity.

### Day 3: Updating your forked GitHub repo

Redo the steps in Day 3 to pull in my recent changes.

### Interaction terms

In your `username/activity03-mlr` repo, go into the
`day03-other-considerations` subfolder and follow the tasks listed in
the `README`. You will continue to work in your `activity03.Rmd` file
that you started during Day 1 of this activity.

## Task 5: Updating your forked GitHub repo, again

You will need to start reading these directions back at my `gvsu-sta631/activity03-mlr` GitHub repo **and** have your forked `username/activity03-mlr` GitHub repo handy.
I recommend that you have my repo opened on one half of your screen and your repo opened on the other half.
Read these directions first, then work through them.

1. At the top of your `username/activity03-mlr` repo (above the repo contents section), verify that you see a message that looks something like:
  
  > This branch is X commits behind gvsu-sta631:main.
  
2. Click on the hyperlinked "X commits behind" portion of that message to be taken to a **Comparing changes** page.
3. Verify that your drop-down menu options specify:
    - base repository: username/activity03-mlr
    - base: main
    - head repository: gvsu-sta631/activity03-mlr
    - compare: main
4. Also verify that you have a message directly below this that says:

  > &check; Able to merge. These branches can be automatically merged.
  
  Flag me if you see something different.

5. Click on the green **Create pull request** button under this previous message.
  Note you can look at the changes that I made, if you so desire, by scrolling down.
  However, this is not necessary.
6. On the next page, provide a short descriptive message in the "Title" box (e.g., "Adding Day 3 materials").
  You can also provide a more detailed message in the "Leave a comment" box if you choose.
7. Click on the green **Create pull request** button.
8. On the next screen which is titled the same thing as what you provided in the "Title" box on the previous screen, you will be presented with a bunch of information.
  If you scroll down a little, you should see a green check mark with a message that specifies:
  
  > This branch has no conflicts with the base branch
  
  And you can click on the green **Merge pull request**.
  
9. You will be provided with with an opportunity to provide another meaningful message (or accept the default message).
  Finally, click on the green **Confirm merge** button.
  You can now work directly from your `username/activity03-mlr` repo.
  
In summary, what you just did is pulled my changes into your repository.
Git and GitHub refer to this as a "pull request" because you are asking to pull items into your repo.

## Task 6: Assessing a multiple linear regression model

In your `username/activity03-mlr` repo, go into the `day03-other-considerations` subfolder and follow the tasks listed in the `README`.
You will continue to work in your `activity03.Rmd` file that you started during Day 1 of this activity.
