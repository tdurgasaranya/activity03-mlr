Day 2 - Assessing a MLR Model
================

In this repository/directory you should see two items:

- `README.md` - this document.

You will continue working in your `activity03.Rmd` file that you started
on [Day 1](../day01-quantitative-explanatory) and continued on [Day
2](../day02-qualitative-explanatory). Specifically, we will expand your
model from Day 2 that had one quantitative explanatory variable and one
qualitative explanatory variable with two levels - for ease of
interpretability. However, before we continue let’s take some time to
pause and reflect.

![check-in](README-img/noun-magnifying-glass.png) **Check in**

Either from memory or looking back at what I asked you to do in Activity
1 - Day 3 and throughout Activities 2 & 3, what has been our analysis
process? Note that this is my opinionated process, but I want you to
take a few moments to sketch, list, or map the process we have used.
Hint: we have not simply fit a regression model to data and been done -
there was pre-work and post-work.

I will give you 5 minutes individually and then 10 minutes in small
groups. In your individual time, try to list everything you did and try
to generalize it. In your group time, compare processes and then try to
come up with an agreed upon “modeling pipeline”. Then, we will map out
our current modeling pipeline ideas as a class.

## Task 1: Pull your changes from GitHub into RStudio

You successfully updated your GitHub repo from the main
[`README`](../README), but we still need to update your RStudio files.
Read these directions first, then work through them.

- In the **Git** pane of RStudio (upper right-hand area), locate and
  click on the
  <img src="../README-img/pull-icon.png" alt="knit" width = "20"/>
  **Pull** icon.
- After a few moments (you might need to provide your GitHub username
  and PAT), your **Files** pane will be updated with the new items.

Since you are likely looking at the `README` (this page) on GitHub,
nothing of importance for your work today was brought in. However, it is
always a good habit to **pull** from GitHub before starting to work
after taking a break. For example, if you were collaborating on a
project with others, they might do work at different times than you (or
even at the same time). It is always good to solve problems on your end
before **push**ing to GitHub and causing more problems.

## Today

We will explore a MLR model with an interaction between quantitative and
qualitative explanatory variables as well as see some other methods to
assess the fit of our model. From the modeling process we came up with
as a class, we will now address the “series of important questions that
we should consider when performing multiple linear regression” (*ISL*
[Section 3.2.2](https://hastie.su.domains/ISLR2/ISLRv2_website.pdf),
p. 75):

1.  Is at least one of the $p$ predictors $X_1$, $X_2$, $\ldots$, $X_p$
    useful in predicting the response $Y$?
2.  Do all the predictors help to explain $Y$, or is only a subset of
    the predictors useful?
3.  How well does the model fit the data?
4.  Given a set of predictor values, what response value should we
    predict and how accurate is our prediction?

Note that the text (*ISL*) covers interactions between two quantitative
explanatory variables as well. By including an interaction term in our
model, we are relaxing the “additive assumption” a little. However, some
folk think of the additive assumption being about the coefficients (the
$\beta$s) and not the variables.

## Task 2: Overall model - is at least one predictor useful?

### Fitting the overall model with $qualitative \times quantitative$ interaction

Recall from Day 2 that you explored the model:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{qualitative_variable} + \beta_2 \times \text{quantitative_variable} + \varepsilon
$$

Today we will explore a similar model, except that also includes the
interaction between your qualitative and quantitative explanatory
variables. That is,

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{qualitative_variable} + \beta_2 \times \text{quantitative_variable} + \beta_3 \times ( \text{qualitative_variable} \times \text{quantitative_variable}) + \varepsilon
$$

- Open your `activity03.Rmd` file and
  <img src="../README-img/knit-icon.png" alt="knit" width = "20"/>
  **knit** it to run the work you completed during Days 1 & 2 of this
  activity.

- Create a new R code chunk and type the following (replacing
  information as appropriate for your data), then run your code chunk or
  knit your document.

  ``` r
  #fit the mlr model
  lm_spec <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_mode("regression") %>%
  set_engine("lm")

  int_mod <- lm_spec %>% 
  fit(response ~ qualitative * quantitative, data = data)

  tidy(int_mod)
  ```

Note that I shortened the model statement using
`qualitative * quantitative`, but this can sometimes be confusing to
read. Another way to write the right-hand side of the equation is:
`qualitative + quantitative + qualitative * quantitative`.

After doing this, answer the following question:

1.  When viewing the `tidy` output, notice that the interaction term is
    listed as `qualitativelevel:quantitative`. Referring back to Day 2
    with how R displays qualitative variables, interpret what this
    syntax means.

2.  Using page 100 of *ISL* as a reference, if needed, and your work
    from Day 2, write the simplified equation of the line corresponding
    to each level of your qualitative explanatory variable.

3.  For two observations with similar values of the quantitative , which
    level tends to have higher values of the response variable?

4.  Like you did in Day 1, assess the fit of this model (no need to do
    any formal hypothesis testing - we will explore this next). How does
    `int_mod`’s fit compare to `mlr_mod`? What did you use to compare
    these? Why?

Recall our brief discussion on how many disciplines are moving away from
$p$-values in favor of other methods. We will explore these other
methods in Modules 3 & 4, but we will practice our classical methods
here. This is known as an “overall $F$ test” and the hypotheses are:

That (the null) no predictors are useful for the model (i.e., all slopes
are equal to zero) versus the alternative that at least one predictor is
useful for the model (i.e., at least one slope is not zero). One way to
check this is to build our null model (no predictors) and then compare
this to our candidate model (`int_mod`).

- Create a new R code chunk and type the following (replacing
  information as appropriate for your data), then run your code chunk or
  knit your document.

  ``` r
  # null model
  null_mod <- lm_spec %>% 
  fit(response ~ 1, data = data)

  anova(
    extract_fit_engine(int_mod),
    extract_fit_engine(null_mod)
  )
  ```

5.  Using your background knowledge of $F$ tests, what is the $F$ test
    statistic and $p$-value for this test? Based on an $\alpha = 0.05$
    significant level, what should you conclude?

## Task 3: Partial slope test - do all predictors help explain $y$?

Assuming that your overall model is significant (at least one predictor
is useful), we will continue on. Continue through these next tasks even
if your overall model was not significant.

We could do a similar process to fit a new model while removing one
explanatory variable at at time, and using `anova` to compare these
models. However, the `tidy` output also helps here (the `statistic` and
`p.value` columns).

For each slope, you are testing if that slope is zero (when including
the other variables, the null) or if it is not zero (when including the
other variables, the alternative). Because the interaction term is a
combination of the other two variables, we should assess the first.

6.  What is the $t$ test statistic and $p$-value associated with this
    test? Based on an $\alpha = 0.05$ significant level, what should you
    conclude?

If your interaction term was not significant, you could consider
removing it. Now look at your two non-interaction terms…

7.  What are the $t$ test statistic and $p$-value associated with these
    tests? Based on an $\alpha = 0.05$ significant level, what should
    you conclude about these two predictors?

You would not need to do (7) if the interaction was significant. You
also should not remove a main variable (non-interaction variable) if the
interaction variable remains in your model.

## Task 4: Residual assessment - how well does the model fit the data?

You have already done this step in past activities by exploring your
residuals. Using your final model from Task 3, assess how well your
model fits the data.

## Task 5: Prediciton - what response value should we predict for new values

If you split your data into training and testing subsets, use your
testing dataset to predict. Also, assess how well your trained model
does on this new data (your test data).

## What is next?

We will set the scene for classification models and have a friendly
competition in our class meetings to apply our MLR modeling skills. For
the competition, I will provide you with some additional tools and how
to describe the output to help you assess models (i.e., studentized
residual plots, leverage points, and variance inflation factors).

<!--You will continue working in your `day01-fitting/activity03.Rmd` file that you started on [Day 1](../day01-fitting).

## Task 1: Pull your changes from GitHub into RStudio

You successfully updated your GitHub repo from the main [`README`](../README), but we still need to update your RStudio files.

For example, if you were collaborating on a project with others, they might do work at different times than you (or even at the same time).

## Some Important Questions

From [Section 3.2.2](https://hastie.su.domains/ISLR2/ISLRv2_website.pdf) of *ISL* (p. 75), you read of a series important questions that we should consider when performing multiple linear regression (copied here for ease of access):

1. Is at least one of the $p$ predictors $X_1$, $X_2$, $\ldots$, $X_p$ useful in predicting the response $Y$?
2. Do all the predictors help to explain $Y$, or is only a subset of the predictors useful?
3. How well does the model fit the data?
4. Given a set of predictor values, what response value should we predict and how accurate is our prediction?

We will explore these questions using the Human Freedom Index dataset.

## Task 2: Overall model - is at least one predictor useful?

### Fitting the overall model

**I forgot to include this in Day 1: Like we did with SLR (Activity 2), we will only focus on data from 2016.**
**Update your code when you read in the dataset to then create `hfi_2016` which contains all observations from 2016.**

We will explore a different model on this day, and I encourage you to go back through Day 1 materials using this new model - when you have time.
Note (mostly a note to myself) that future iterations of this course will only use this model instead of what was done on Day 1.


$$
\texttt{pf\\_score} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \texttt{pf\\_expression\\_influence} + \beta_2 \times \texttt{pf\\_expression\\_control} + \varepsilon
$$

- Open your `day01-fitting/activity03.Rmd` file and <img src="../README-img/knit-icon.png" alt="knit" width = "20"/> **knit** it to run the work you completed during Day 1 of this activity.
- Create a new R code chunk and type the following, then run your code chunk or knit your document.
  
  
  ```r
  # review any visual patterns
  hfi %>% 
    select(pf_score, pf_expression_influence, pf_expression_control) %>% 
    ggpairs()
  
  #fit the mlr model
  m_pf <- lm(pf_score ~ pf_expression_influence + pf_expression_control, data = hfi)
  tidy(m_pf)
  ```

You should obtain the following estimated model:

$$
\hat{y} = 4.71 + 0.188 \times \texttt{pf\\_expression\\_influence} + 0.288 \times \texttt{pf\\_expression\\_control}
$$

Interpretation of these parameter estimates (i.e., the *y*-intercept and two slopes) are now slight different than how we interpreted the parameter estimates for an SLR model.
This is because we now have more information in our model so we need to include that in our interpretations:

> For countries with a `pf_expression_influence` of 0 (those with the largest amount of laws/regulations on media content) and `pf_expression_control` of 0 (those with the largest amount of political pressure on media content), we expect their mean personal freedom score to be 4.71.

> For a given `pf_expression_control` value (i.e., a given level of laws/regulations on media content), a 1 unit increase in `pf_expression_influence` is associated with a 0.188 unit increase of a country's mean personal freedom score.

> For a given `pf_expression_influence` value (i.e., a given level of political pressure on media content), a 1 unit increase in `pf_expression_control` is associated with a 0.288 unit increase of a country's mean personal freedom score.

Look back at the `ggpairs` output from above.
Does the relationship appear linear, between $Y$ and each of $X_1$ and $X_2$?
If so, we can quantify the strength of the relationship with the correlation coefficient ($r$; these are displayed in the upper right-hand triangle of the `ggpairs` output as "Corr: ...").

Note that this also provided a visual and numerical summary of the relationship between $X_1$ and $X_2$.
We will circle back to this in Activity 4, but for now will only focus on the potential relationships between the response variable and each predictor variable.

Answer the following questions:

1. What do these (two) correlation values mean in the context of this model?

## Is there a relationship between the response and predictors?

We visually assessed if there appeared to be a linear relationship between the response and each predictor variable (along with providing a measurement of the strength and direction of that relationship if it is linear).
Now we would like to assess if this relationship is "note worthy".
That is, is there overwhelming evidence that at least one of the slopes associated with this MLR model exists (or is not zero).
If a slope is zero (e.g., if $\beta_1 = 0$), that would indicate no relationship.

We can do this by testing the overall model.
The statistical hypotheses that we are testing are:

$$
\begin{align}
H_0&: \beta_1 = \beta_2 = 0 \\
H_a&: \text{At least one }\beta_j\text{ is not zero, for }j = 1, 2
\end{align}
$$

From your reading, this hypothesis test is performed using teh $F$-statistic which has two degrees of freedom associated with it ($df_{model} = p; df_{error} = n - p - 1$).

- Create a new R code chunk and type the following code.
  
  
  ```r
  summary(m_pf)
  ```

There is a lot of information that gets produced here and I am always cautious of using functions that produce a lot without directly asking for things - looking at you, SAS.
However, the information we need to assess the overall model is the very last line of the output:

> `F-statistic:  1308 on 2 and 1375 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16`

This provides us with the $F$-statistic, the corresponding degrees of freedom (model and error, respectively) and the corresponding $p$-value under the assumption that none of explanatory variables are useful in our model.

$$
\begin{align}
F &= 1308 \\
df_{model} &= 2; df_{error} = 1308 \\
p\text{-value} &< 0.0001
\end{align}
$$

Answer the following questions:

2. Using a significance level of $\alpha = 0.05$, make a decision with respect to the hypotheses we are testing.
3. Based on the decision you made in (2), what does this mean? That is, interpret the decision in the context of these data.

## Task 3: Deciding on important variables

Since we have a small number of predictors that we are considering ($p = 2$), we can "easily" explore all four potential models: the model containing no predictors, the (two) models containing each individual predictor, and the model containing both predictors.
The text goes into three *classical* methods for automating this tasks, but I want to caution you for using "black box" methods that are very data-hungry and actually make our analyses less powerful (from the statistical definition of [**power**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_a_test)).
We will explore alternative methods to these classical approaches and I want to encourage you to avoid these automated variable selection processes.

Answer the following questions:

4. Looking back at your `tidy` output, you hopefully noticed columns named: `std.error`, `statistic`, and `p.value`.
  The values in the `statistic` column are calculated by taking the value in `estimate` column and dividing it by the value in the `std.error` column.
  Verify that the `statistic` values for `pf_expression_influence` and `pf_expression_control` are correct.
5. Do you know what type of `statistic` these values are?
  Hint: you obtained an $F$-statistic in Task 2, these are not $F$-statistics.
6. These `statistic` values also have a corresponding degrees of freedom associated with them in order to obtain the values in the `p.value` column.
  Each `statistic` value has the degrees of freedom corresponding to the error of the overall model.
  What are the degrees of freedom for both of these statistics (label and value)?
7. Since the `statistic` values are on the same scale (they are from the same distribution with the error degrees of freedome), we can compare them to one another.
  Does one seem more important than the other using your knowledge of this distributions shape (might need to Google what this distribution from (5) looks like)?
  Explain your reasoning.
  
We will explore ways to assess if any predictors are more "important" than others later in this course.

## Task 4: Model fit

To assess the overall model fit, remember that for SLR models we explored the proportion of variability in the response variable that is explained by the linear relationship with the explanatory variables.
We can get a similar measurement for MLR models.

- Create a new R code chunk and type the following code.
  
  
  ```r
  glance(m_pf)
  ```

After doing this and running the code, answer the following questions:

8. What is the value of $R^2$ for this model?
9. What does this value mean in the context of this model?
10. This model is similar to the model you fit in Activity 2 except with one additional explanatory variable.
  Compare the $R^2$ value from your SLR model to this $R^2$ value.
  What do you notice?
  That is, is one "better" than the other?
  Explain your reasoning.

Looking back at your `summary(m_pf)` output, you may also have noticed that the RSE (residual standard error) is also provided:

> `Residual standard error: 0.8077 on 1375 degrees of freedom`  
> `(80 observations deleted due to missingness)`

I often use this value (and the $R^2$ value) to compare between "candidate" or potential models.
When we cover methods to compare between models, we will discuss how to use these values.

Now we will assess the residuals of our MLR model fit.

**Linearity**: You already checked if the relationship between `pf_score` and `pf_expression_influence` and between `pf_score` and `pf_expression_control` is linear using.
We should also verify this condition with a plot of the residuals vs. fitted (predicted) values once we have fit a MLR model.

- Create a new R code chunk and type the following code.
  
  
  ```r
  # obtain fitted values and residuals
  m_pf_aug <- augment(m_pf)
  
  # plot fitted values and residuals
  ggplot(data = m_pf_aug, aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
    xlab("Fitted values") +
    ylab("Residuals")
  ```

After doing this and running the code, answer the following question:

11. Is there any apparent pattern in the residuals plot?
  What does this indicate about the linearity of the relationship between the two variables?

**Nearly normal residuals**: To check this condition, we can look at a histogram of the residuals.

- Create a new R code chunk and type the following code.
  
  
  ```r
  ggplot(data = m_pf_aug, aes(x = .resid)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.25) +
    xlab("Residuals")
  ```

After doing this and running the code, answer the following question:

9. Based on the histogram, does the nearly normal residuals condition appear to be violated?
  Why or why not?


**Constant variability**:

10. Based on the residuals vs. fitted plot, does the constant variability condition appear to be violated?
  Why or why not?


## Task 5: Prediction

Similar to predicting values for a SLR model, we can identify (appropriate - i.e., avoiding *extrapolation*) values of our explanatory values to obtain an estimate of the response.
The text (pp. 81--82) describes three sorts of uncertainty associated with predictions and we will see this in action later this semester.
For the time being, let's keep things focused and we will obtain a confidence interval and a prediction interval for a given country's personal freedom score.

The values for our variables of interest associated with the United States in 2016 are:





```r
hfi %>% 
  filter(countries == "United States" & year == 2016) %>% 
  select(pf_score, pf_expression_influence, pf_expression_control)
```

```
## # A tibble: 1 × 3
##   pf_score pf_expression_influence pf_expression_control
##      <dbl>                   <dbl>                 <dbl>
## 1     8.75                       8                     7
```

We are going to do some "fancy" programming here and will see alternative ways to do this once we get more familiar with modeling in general (i.e., using more of `{tidymodels}` capabilities).
Essentially what this code is doing is pulling out the $X$ values we are interested in predicting for an existing observation (`hfi %>% filter(...)`), then passing those observations as the second argument of the `predict` function using the `.` method. 

- Create a new R code chunk and type the following code.
  
  
  ```r
  hfi %>% 
    filter(countries == "United States" & year == 2016) %>% 
    predict(m_pf, .)
  ```

The `predict` function takes a model object (i.e., `m_pf`) and applies it to a list/dataframe/tibble of values.
Notice that I am not focusing/`select`ing specific columns here - the `m_pf` object knows what information to for!

After doing this and running the code, complete the following items:

11. Using your estimated equation, calculate the predicted value to verify that your code matches your math.
12. The actual personal freedom score for the United States in 2016 was 8.74731. 
  Calculate the residual by hand. Look at the `m_pf`.
13. **Challenge**: Using the `m_pf_aug` object from before and your advance `{dplyr}` skills (I can think of a couple of different ways to go about this), verify your answers in (11) and (12) by finding the corresponding row for the United States in 2016.
  While this object does not have information on countries or year, the rows line up with the rows in `hfi`.

## What is next?

We will look at ways to include non-quantitative features as well as discuss other details to be aware of and consider when building MLR models.
